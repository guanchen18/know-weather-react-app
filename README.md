# know-weather-react-app

This is a weather react app that allows users to get current weather information after typing a city and country. 

React.js project built with [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Installment
````
git clone https://github.com/guanchen18/know-weather-react-app
cd my-weather-app
npm install dateformat
npm install
npm start
````
As I am a React beginner myself, I always look for ways to learn more. So if you have any ideas to improve the app we have built, please let me know. I will fix it then! 

## News
 I am working on deploying the weather app.
 
 I am also in process of adding Google Autocomple feature within the searchbar.
